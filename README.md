# Weather App

This is a simple weather app that allows users to check the weather for a particular location. It utilizes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend, and it fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, you will need to create an account on OpenWeatherMap and generate your API key. You can sign up [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up). Once you have your API key, follow the instructions below to install and run the app locally.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd weather-app
   ```

3. Open the `index.js` file in your preferred text editor.

4. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key:

   ```javascript
   const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
   ```

5. Save the changes and close the file.

### Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

2. In the search bar, enter the location for which you want to check the weather.

3. Click on the "Search" button.

4. The app will display the current weather information for the specified location.
